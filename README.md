## Overview
For my first QA automation project, I built a test automation framework using the practice website Sauce Demo(https://www.saucedemo.com/). Applying what I've learned from Udemy courses, I structured the framework following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The framework supports multiple browsers, generates detailed HTML reports, logging, and automatically captures screenshots upon test failures.

## Usage
> [!Note]
> All commands are ran within the `tests` folder/directory.

To run all test in the test suite from the command prompt (cmd) with the following command:
```
pytest
```
To run a specific test from the test suite:
```
pytest test_login_standard_user.py
```
To generate a html report `--html [where to generate report]` needs to be included in the command, example:
```
pytest test_login_standard_user.py  --html ../reports/report.html
```
Chrome is the default browser to specify which browser to run the tests on `â€”browser_name [chrome/firefox/ie]` needs to be included in the command, example:
```
pytest test_login_standard_user.py  --html ../reports/report.html --browser_name firefox
```
